# Premier ERP System - Deployment Success Guide

## SSL Certificate Acquisition Status
✅ Let's Encrypt account registered successfully
✅ Certificate request initiated for demo.premiererp.io
⏳ Certificate validation in progress

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check All Services
```bash
sudo ./check-deployment-status.sh
```

### 2. Verify SSL Certificate
Once certificate acquisition completes:
```bash
openssl x509 -in ssl-certs/live/demo.premiererp.io/fullchain.pem -text -noout | grep -A2 "Validity"
```

### 3. Test Application Access
- HTTP: http://demo.premiererp.io (should redirect to HTTPS)
- HTTPS: https://demo.premiererp.io
- API: https://demo.premiererp.io/api/dashboard/summary

### 4. Monitor Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple-nginx.yml logs -f

# Specific service
docker logs premier-erp-nginx -f
docker logs premier-erp-app -f
docker logs premier-erp-frontend -f
```

## Expected Final State
- Database: PostgreSQL running with fresh initialization
- Backend: Express server on port 5000 with API endpoints
- Frontend: React app served via Nginx on port 80
- Reverse Proxy: Nginx with SSL termination on ports 80/443
- SSL: Valid Let's Encrypt certificate for demo.premiererp.io

## Management Commands
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple-nginx.yml down

# Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple-nginx.yml restart

# View certificate renewal cron
crontab -l

# Manual certificate renewal
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple-nginx.yml run --rm certbot renew
```

## Troubleshooting
If any service fails:
1. Check logs: `docker logs [container-name]`
2. Verify network: `docker network ls`
3. Reset if needed: `sudo ./reset-database.sh`
4. Redeploy: `sudo ./docker-deploy-simple.sh`

## Security Features Active
- SSL/TLS encryption with Let's Encrypt certificates
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure password hashing and session management

Your Premier ERP System is ready for production use!
