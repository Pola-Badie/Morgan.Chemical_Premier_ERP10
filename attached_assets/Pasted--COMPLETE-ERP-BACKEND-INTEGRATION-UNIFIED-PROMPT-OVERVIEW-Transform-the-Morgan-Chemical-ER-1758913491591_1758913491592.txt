## PART 2: API ENDPOINTS

Create these exact endpoints:

```
GET /api/reports/trial-balance?startDate=&endDate=
GET /api/reports/profit-loss?startDate=&endDate=
GET /api/reports/balance-sheet?asOfDate=
GET /api/reports/cash-flow?startDate=&endDate=
GET /api/reports/chart-of-accounts
GET /api/reports/journal-entries?startDate=&endDate=&status=
GET /api/reports/general-ledger?accountId=&startDate=&endDate=
GET /api/reports/account-summary
GET /api/reports/aging-analysis?type=receivables
GET /api/reports/:reportType/pdf
GET /api/reports/:reportType/excel
```

**Each endpoint must return proper JSON with:**
- reportType (string)
- generatedAt (date)
- period/asOfDate (date range)
- Actual calculated data from database
- Proper financial calculations
- Error handling

## PART 3: FRONTEND INTEGRATION

### 3.1 API Service Layer

- getChartOfAccounts()
- getJournalEntries(startDate, endDate, status)
- getGeneralLedger(accountId, startDate, endDate)
