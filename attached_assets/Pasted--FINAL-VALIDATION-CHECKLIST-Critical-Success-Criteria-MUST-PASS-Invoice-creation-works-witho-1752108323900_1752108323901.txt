COMPREHENSIVE ERP SYSTEM TESTING - ALL AREAS

Perform complete testing of the Premier ERP system across backend APIs, frontend UI, database integrity, security, performance, and integration. Test EVERYTHING systematically and report detailed findings.

## üîß BACKEND API TESTING

### 1. INVOICE CREATION API TESTS
Test POST /api/invoices endpoint:
- Create invoice with customer and product data
- Verify 201 Created response with correct invoice data
- Test error handling for invalid data
- Check for TypeError, 500 errors, null responses
- Verify invoice data saves to database correctly

### 2. DATABASE INTEGRATION TESTS
Execute these SQL queries to verify data integrity:
```sql
-- Test invoice data persistence
SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = [new_invoice_id];
SELECT * FROM invoice_items WHERE invoice_id = [new_invoice_id];

-- Test accounting entries creation
SELECT * FROM journal_entries WHERE reference = 'INV-[invoice_number]';
SELECT * FROM journal_entry_lines WHERE journal_entry_id = [entry_id];

-- Test data consistency
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM customers);
-- Should return 0

-- Test accounting balance
SELECT SUM(debit_amount) - SUM(credit_amount) FROM journal_entry_lines;
-- Should return 0
3. MEMORY USAGE MONITORING
