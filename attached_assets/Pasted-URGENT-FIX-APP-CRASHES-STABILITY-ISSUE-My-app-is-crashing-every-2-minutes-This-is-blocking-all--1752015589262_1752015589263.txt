URGENT: FIX APP CRASHES - STABILITY ISSUE

My app is crashing every 2 minutes. This is blocking all development and testing. Please diagnose and fix all stability issues immediately.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL STABILITY FIXES NEEDED

### 1. MEMORY LEAK INVESTIGATION
- Check for memory leaks in React components
- Fix any infinite loops or recursive function calls
- Remove unnecessary event listeners
- Clean up useEffect dependencies and cleanup functions
- Fix any circular references

### 2. DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUES
- Fix database connection pool exhaustion
- Add proper connection error handling
- Implement connection retry logic
- Check for unclosed database connections
- Add database connection timeout settings

### 3. SERVER STABILITY FIXES
- Add proper error handling to all API routes
- Fix any unhandled promise rejections
- Add try-catch blocks to all async functions
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Fix any synchronous operations blocking the event loop

### 4. FRONTEND CRASH PREVENTION
- Add React Error Boundaries to catch component crashes
- Fix any infinite re-renders
- Remove console.log statements that might cause issues
- Fix any undefined variable access
- Add proper null checks

### 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
- Limit API request frequency
- Add request debouncing for search/filter operations
- Fix any large data loading without pagination
- Optimize image and file handling
- Clean up intervals and timers

### 6. COMMON CRASH CAUSES TO FIX
- Fix any missing dependencies in useEffect
- Repair broken API endpoints returning errors
- Fix malformed database queries
- Correct any infinite state updates
- Remove any synchronous file operations

### 7. ADD CRASH RECOVERY
- Implement automatic restart on crash
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Create health check endpoints
- Add monitoring for memory usage
- Implement graceful error handling

### 8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize database queries
- Reduce bundle size
- Fix any memory-intensive operations
- Add loading states to prevent multiple concurrent requests

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

1. **Check Console Errors**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
2. **Check Server Logs**: Identify server-side error patterns
3. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Check for memory spikes before crashes
4. **Database Connection**: Verify database stability
5. **API Response Times**: Check for hanging requests

## âœ… STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

The app should:
- Run continuously without crashes
- Handle errors gracefully without crashing
- Manage memory efficiently
- Maintain stable database connections
- Provide smooth user experience

**PRIORITY: Make the app stable and crash-free before any other features. This is blocking all development work.**

Report what's causing the crashes and implement fixes immediately.
