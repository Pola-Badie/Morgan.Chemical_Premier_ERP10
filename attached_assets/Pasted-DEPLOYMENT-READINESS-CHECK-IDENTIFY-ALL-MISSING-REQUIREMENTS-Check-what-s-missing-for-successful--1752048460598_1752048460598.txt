DEPLOYMENT READINESS CHECK - IDENTIFY ALL MISSING REQUIREMENTS

Check what's missing for successful deployment and execution. Audit the entire system for deployment readiness and identify all gaps.

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS AUDIT

### 1. BUILD SYSTEM CHECK
**Verify these exist and work:**
- [ ] package.json with correct scripts (build, start, dev)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation setup (tsconfig.json)
- [ ] Frontend build process (Vite/React build)
- [ ] Backend compilation (TypeScript to JavaScript)
- [ ] Production dependencies properly listed
- [ ] Dev dependencies separated from production

### 2. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
**Check for missing environment setup:**
- [ ] .env files for different environments
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database connection strings
- [ ] API keys and secrets management
- [ ] Port configuration for production
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS configuration

### 3. DATABASE DEPLOYMENT SETUP
**Verify database readiness:**
- [ ] Database schema migration scripts
- [ ] Initial data seeding scripts
- [ ] Database backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Database performance optimization

### 4. SERVER CONFIGURATION
**Check server setup requirements:**
- [ ] Proper server startup scripts
